        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Last year, I met with several technical writers for a virtual round table discussion
            about technical writing in all its forms. My panel included Lauren Maffeo (author),
            Lauren Pritchett (editor), and Don Watkins and Chris Hermansen (writers), all of whom
            shared their experience in technical writing. This was a very insightful conversation
            where we discussed several topics including:<itemizedlist>

                            use?</emphasis> We discussed a variety of methods for writing with
                        digital technology, including Markdown, GitHub, and LibreOffice. </para>

                    <para><emphasis role="bold">What's your writing process? Some</emphasis> of us
                        research a topic before writing about it, and others learn more about it as
                        they go. Explain it like you're talking to a friend.</para>

        <title>Advice for new writers</title>
        <para>Lauren Pritchett shared excellent advice to write about what you find interesting and
            don't worry if someone else has covered the topic too:<blockquote>
                <para>Just because something has been written about before doesn't mean it doesn't
                    deserve more attention. There's already a market out there for readers, so take
                    advantage of that. And your opinion matters, you add value to the discussion,
                    whether you're a beginner or advanced. </para>
            </blockquote></para>
        <para>Lauren Maffeo had recently written a book and shared that her publisher uses GitHub
            and Markdown. As Lauren explained, "This is a workflow built around developers and technical folks." 
            Technical writers using Markdown, GitHub, text editors, and other
            tools that application development teams use is quite common in organizations with
            in-house engineering. In fact, the process has a name: Docs as Code. This allows the
            technical writers to become more integrated with the engineering teams, which is not
            possible if the technical writer maintains a parallel yet separate workflow using
            Microsoft Word and shared drives.</para>

        <title>How to gain experience</title>
        <para>There are many ways to gain experience in technical writing. One path with a low
            barrier to entry is writing about open source software. For example, you might write an
            article about any of these topics:</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Download an open source application and try it out. </emphasis>You
                    could write about 5 things you taught yourself about using LibreOffice over a
                    weekend, or the process you followed to create a business card using
                    Scribus.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Experiment with a LiveCD version of a Linux distribution.</emphasis>
                    Many Linux distributions provide a LiveCD, so you don't actually have to install
                    the system to use it. Boot a LiveCD and see what you can do, then write an
                    article about 4 things you learned about using Fedora Linux, or what it was like
                    using Ubuntu Linux as a first-time user.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Write about a topic you learned about in a class.</emphasis> For
                    example, you might write an article about 6 cool things you learned to do with
                    Markdown, or 4 things you learned about managing documentation in GitHub</para>

        <title>Where to Publish</title>
        <para>Most websites that advertise an open community welcome new authors. If you aren't
            sure, check the website's banner or footer for a link about how to contact the editor.
            Websites that would gladly run articles about open source software include:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>All Things is an article website attached the the All Things Open
                        conference, but they run articles about any kind of open source. They
                        especially like to publish how-to articles.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Both.org is an open community website that casts a wide net, including
                        Linux, open source software, and programming. They publish daily and are
                        always looking for new contributors.</para>

                    <para>Linux Journal is the oldest magazine or website about the Linux operating
                        system. They prefer to run only articles about Linux, such as first-time
                        experiences with Linux. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Fedora Magazine is focused on the Fedora distribution of Linux. Articles
                        should focus on what you can do with Fedora Linux. They are an open
                        community, and they also welcome volunteer editors.</para>
